## Problem Prompts

#### _Soda Machine_
You have an old soda vending machine used in blind taste tests. The machine has three buttons labeled, "Coke," "Pepsi," and "Surprise." Whichever button is pressed, a nondescript can of soda pops out containing either Pepsi or Coke - the surprise button is supposed to randomly give a can of one or the other. Trouble is, some rascal has gone and messed with the labels. Luckily, you are an expert at telling the difference between Pepsi and Coke, so if you sample one of the cans, you will be able to determine which soda it is (even though the can is no help). How many sodas must you drink to guarantee you will be able to put the labels back where they belong?

##### Notes for the Interviewer
This is a good warm up problem. The real point here is for the interviewee to actually find out the constraints. Mainly that ALL of the labels are incorrect. If they ask tell them this. If they don't, and assume that the labels may or may not be correct let them continue to ruminate about it and go off course.

#### _25 Horses_
Letâ€™s say that you have 25 horses, and you want to pick the fastest 3 horses out of those 25. In each race, only 5 horses can run at the same time because there are only 5 tracks. What is the minimum number of races required to find the 3 fastest horses.

##### Notes for the Interviewer
Once again this exercise is about communication. The goal is to intentionally vague to force the interviewee to ask you questions about the contrainst and nuances of the problem. Do not tell them that the horses 

###### Hints
1. You know the finishing positions of the horses.
2. There is no stopwatch.

###### Hints
1. What if you discovered that the surprise button gave you a Coke?
2. (Only if they ask!) All of the labels are incorrect.

#### _Cyclical Linked List_
Write a function to detect if a linked list has a "cycle" (a loop), without extra storage.

E.g., A->B->C->B is a linked list with a loop in it. 
How can you programmatically determine that it has a cycle, without using any other data structures?
